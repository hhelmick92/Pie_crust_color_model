The code files contained within this repository were used as part of a publication under review in the Journal of Food Science. 

The code files here were used to do the following:
1) Convert images of paper from RGB to L*, a*, b* and compare to values from a colorimeter
2) Train and validate machine learning models (ANN, RF) to predict the L*, a*, b* values from images
3) Crop pictures of pie crusts using Canny Edge detection
4) Determine the L*, a*, b* values of these images at different lighting conditions.

A full description of how this works can be found in our publication:
